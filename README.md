# Riddler-Classic-2.19.2019

Riddler equivalent of showing my work on a test. I didn't do any math I just wrote some code that compares one deck's winrate against another's after 100,000 trials. So I don't have an exact number but I have a decent approximation.

Red deck loses to Black 70/30
Blue deck loses to Red 70/30
Black deck loses to Blue 70/30

Hope you got some good odds to play this game.
